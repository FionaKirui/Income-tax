# ping-pong
This is an  assignment on object-oriented programming.
It tests the understanding of  necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops.
if the number is divisible by 3 print ping;
if the number is divisible by 5 print pong;
if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 print ping-pong;
else, print the number.

## Code Example
9 is divisible by 3 hence ping;
10 is divisible by 5 hence pong;
15 is divisible by 3 and 5 hence ping-pong;
19 is not divisible by either number hence, print the number;
